        <h1 id="about-me-text"><span>Hello!</span>My name is <b>Emil Warelius</b>, and I'm from <b>VÃ¤rnamo, Sweden</b>. <br>I'm currently studying Interactive Media and Web technologies at Linnaeus University, where I'm passionate about development and creating engaging digital experiences using different Webtechnologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and more.

          <br><br>My hobbies include playing padel, spending quality time with my family, and exploring my love for cars. I also enjoy staying active by working out regularly. 
          
          <br><span class="inverted">One fun fact about me is that I don't like ice cream, which is quite rare!</span>
          
          <br>I believe in the importance of family, being social, and treating everyone as you'd like to be treated. These values help guide my actions and decisions in life.
          
          <br>As for my goals, I'm focused on having fun in the short term while maintaining a healthy lifestyle and continuing to have fun in the long run. I find joy in the simple things and believe that happiness is an essential component of a fulfilling life.
          
          One of my all-time favorite movies is Batman: The Dark Knight Rises. It's an action-packed, thrilling film with an engaging storyline that never fails to captivate me.
          
          <br><br>If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out! I'm always excited to meet new people and learn from their experiences.
